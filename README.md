# Git

This is a demo of Git basic concepts. Git is awesome!!! To learn the most frequent commands for everyday use, read my post on [How to version control your projects with Git](https://canro91.github.io/2020/05/29/HowToVersionControl/). If you're coming from TFS, read my [Git Guide for TFS users](https://canro91.github.io/2019/11/11/GitGuideForTfsUsers/)

If you want to practice these concepts, feel free to follow [this freeCodeCamp guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/) to fork this project and open a Pull Request with a file just saying Hi!

Enjoy!
